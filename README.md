# 🧠 Project Logic_Gates v2

A simulator and educational tool that demonstrates **how computers work from the ground up — from transistors to the command-line interface (CLI)**. Built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using GDScript.

---

## 🎯 Main Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- **Simulate the fundamental building blocks of digital logic** — transistors, logic gates, registers, memory, and more.
- **Visualize their behavior** through an intuitive graphical interface.
- **Explain the journey from a simple electrical signal to a fully functioning computer** — including a working CLI.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Interactive simulation of logic circuits (gates, switches, bulbs, etc.).
- Custom signal propagation and update system.
- Planned support for:
  - Flip-flops and registers
  - ALU and RAM
  - Basic CPU structure
  - Microcode and instruction decoding
  - Command-line interface (CLI) as the final stage of simulation

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) 4.x  
- GDScript  
- (Optional: Planned integration with Python/Lua CLI simulator)

## 🗺️ Simulation Roadmap

1. **Electronic Components** – transistors, switches  
2. **Logic Circuits** – AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.  
3. **Memory & Processing** – registers, ALU, RAM  
4. **Control Logic** – instruction decoding  
5. **CLI Interpretation** – basic commands like `echo`, `set`, `add`, etc.
